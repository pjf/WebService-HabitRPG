    * DEBUG:    Settng HRPG_DEBUG=1 in the environment now shows
                arguments used to construct a task, *before* that

    * FEATURE:  `hrpg tasks` and `hrpg [daily|todo|habit]` now support

                starting with a '^' will match all tasks with that
                tag.  (Eg: `hrpg daily ^home`)

    * FEATURE:  Experimental tag prefix support. Add a [config]
                section to your ~/.habitrpg file and a
                `tag_prefix = whatever` section if you don't like the
                default tag character of '^'.

                ones.

    * BUGFIX:   The value parameter when creating new tasks

    * CONFIG:   You can now set keep_alive = 0 in the

    * OPTIMISE: Connections to the habitrpg server are now kept-alive

    * FEATURE: Added 'hrpg show' to give detailed stats about a task.

    * FEATURE: Added 'hrpg clear daily' to force unchecking of all daily
               tasks. This is useful if the web server fails to
               uncheck them, or if you never use the web version. (GH #16)

    * FEATURE: Added --beta switch to 'hrpg', which uses the beta API
               server.

    * FEATURE: Added --dev switch to 'hrpg', to use localhost:3000 .

    * FEATURE: WS::HRPG::new_task() supports the 'extend' parameter for
               setting extended attributes.

    * FEATURE: hrpg supports setting extended parameters on task creation.

    * FEATURE: EXPERIMENTAL: _update in WS::HRPG and hrpg. This uses the
               PUT API, and allows for setting arbitrary attributes via
               the API.

    * FEATURE: EXPERIMENTAL: [auth-beta] and [auth-dev] sections may be
               added to the ~/.habitrpgrc file, and their details will
               be used when using the --beta or --dev switches.
