    * FEATURE:  Allow +n and -n to update a habit multiple times.

0.12      2013-04-03 00:46:02 Australia/Melbourne

    * FEATURE:  Added hrpg support for unicode task names and input.
                (Now requires utf8::all)

    * DOCS:    hrpg help screen now mentions history command
               (Thanks @claudinec, GH #20)

    * FEATURE: Added 'hrpg show' to give detailed stats about a task.

    * FEATURE: Added 'hrpg clear daily' to force unchecking of all daily
               tasks. This is useful if the web server fails to
               uncheck them, or if you never use the web version. (GH #16)

    * FEATURE: Added --beta switch to 'hrpg', which uses the beta API
               server.

    * FEATURE: Added --dev switch to 'hrpg', to use localhost:3000 .

    * FEATURE: WS::HRPG::new_task() supports the 'extend' parameter for
               setting extended attributes.

    * FEATURE: hrpg supports setting extended parameters on task creation.

    * FEATURE: EXPERIMENTAL: _update in WS::HRPG and hrpg. This uses the
               PUT API, and allows for setting arbitrary attributes via
               the API.

    * FEATURE: EXPERIMENTAL: [auth-beta] and [auth-dev] sections may be
               added to the ~/.habitrpgrc file, and their details will
               be used when using the --beta or --dev switches.
