                LWP::UserAgent can't/won't find the system
                ones.

    * BUGFIX:   The value parameter when creating new tasks
                is no longer ignored. GH #31, thanks @toddgrotenhuis

0.15      2013-04-09 04:53:30 Australia/Melbourne

    * BUILD:    No longer falsely require WS::Idonethis.
                (Thanks @wizonesolutions)

    * FEATURE:  Added a simple 'hrpg version' command.

    * INTERNAL: Tasks are now fully fledged objects.

    * TEST:     More tests for tasks.

    * FEATURE:  Passing a 'keep_alive' parameter to
                WS::HRPG->new will allow the LWP::UserAgent
                keep-alive behaviour to be specified.

    * CONFIG:   You can now set keep_alive = 0 in the
                [connection] section of ~/.habitrpgrc to
                disable keep-alives.  GH #25

    * BUGFIX:   Detect and skip undef/null values returned by
                the /task endpoint.  GH #27

    * OPTIMISE: Connections to the habitrpg server are now kept-alive
                for faster network ops.

0.13      2013-04-05 17:38:56 Australia/Melbourne

    * FEATURE:  Allow +n and -n to update a habit multiple times.

    * FEATURE:  Added hrpg support for unicode task names and input.
                (Now requires utf8::all)

                supplied with an extend parameter.

    * DOCS:    hrpg help screen now mentions history command
               (Thanks @claudinec, GH #20)

    * FEATURE: Added 'hrpg show' to give detailed stats about a task.

    * FEATURE: Added 'hrpg clear daily' to force unchecking of all daily
               tasks. This is useful if the web server fails to
               uncheck them, or if you never use the web version. (GH #16)

    * FEATURE: Added --beta switch to 'hrpg', which uses the beta API
               server.

    * FEATURE: Added --dev switch to 'hrpg', to use localhost:3000 .

    * FEATURE: WS::HRPG::new_task() supports the 'extend' parameter for
               setting extended attributes.

    * FEATURE: hrpg supports setting extended parameters on task creation.

    * FEATURE: EXPERIMENTAL: _update in WS::HRPG and hrpg. This uses the
               PUT API, and allows for setting arbitrary attributes via
               the API.

    * FEATURE: EXPERIMENTAL: [auth-beta] and [auth-dev] sections may be
               added to the ~/.habitrpgrc file, and their details will
               be used when using the --beta or --dev switches.
